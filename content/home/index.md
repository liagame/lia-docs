Welcome to Lia, a free competitive online game for programmers who want to test their skills against their peers and have lots of fun doing it.
Lia is being built by three students in their spare time and is still a fairly young project. 
Alongside with what you can currently see here there is still much more to come!


## Game description

Your bot commands a fleet of biological units which goal is to eliminate the opponent. 
You start the game with 16 units which you can move around the map, make them shoot and teach them very simple or super advanced tactic to detect, track down and beat the opponent. 
To do that you can use your favourite programming language and your favourite development tools, test out your code on your local machine by fighting your bot against itself and when you are ready, you can upload your bot online to battle countless other programmers around the world!
