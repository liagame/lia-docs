Welcome to Lia, a free competitive online game for programmers who want to test their skills in a fun and collaborative way. The project is highly influenced by Halite and Robocode as well as other programming competitions that never cease to entertain and improve software development community. We have been working on Lia in our spare time at university and is still a very young project. Alongside with what you can currently see here there is still much more to come!
