Welcome to Lia, a free competitive online game for programmers who want to test their skills against their peers and have lots of fun.
Lia is being built by three students in their spare time and is still a fairly young project. 
Alongside with what you can currently see here there is still much more to come!


## Game description

Your bot commands a fleet of biological units which goal is to eliminate the opponent. 
You start the game with 16 units that you can move around the map, make them shoot and teach them very simple or super advanced tactic to detect, track down and beat the opponent. 
You can use your favourite programming language, battle your bots against themselves on your local machine and when you are ready, you can upload them online to battle other programmers around the world!
