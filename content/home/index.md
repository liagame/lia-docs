Welcome to Lia, a free competitive online game for programmers who want to test their skills in a fun and collaborative way. The project is highly influenced by Halite and Robocode as well as other programming competitions that never cease to entertain and improve software development community. We have been working on Lia in our spare time at our university and it is still a very young project. Alongside with what you can currently see here there is still much more to come!

If you wan't to know what the Lia is all about we suggest you to read [game description](/game-description/) and [game rules](/game-rules/). After that if you want to try it out you should go on and read our first [tutorial](/tutorial-part-1/) which will guide you through everything you need in order to start coding.
