## What Data We Collect and Why

When you use your Lia CLI tool to create your bot, fight your bots with each other or play on a tutorial playground we anonymously record (if you opt-in) which CLI command you have run and which parameters you have used. 
This data is then anonymously sent to Google Analytics.

This way we are able to see which commands are used by our community and by doing that we can then see how our Lia-SDK is used. 
This way we can better detect where the bottlenecks are in your Lia experience and so we can more safely decide what we need to fix or add. 
For example if our whole onboarding process is based on the user going through our playgrounds and then running the bots with play command, we cen see if the onboarding was finished successfully. 
If for example we see that most of our users only played on the first playground and not the second, let alone played their own games, we then know that the problem most likely lies in our onboarding and not for example that the play command is not understandable. 
By collecting data we could also see if our users learned how to run their bots in debug mode (which we believe is very important!) and if most of them didn't, we can add some aditional tutorials and examples on our site or do some other stuff to fix that. 


All in all, the data we collect will never expose your identity but it will immensely contribute in making the Lia experience as enjoyable as possible.
