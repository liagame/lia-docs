title: Examples overview

In this part of Lia documentation we have a collection of useful examples that can help you to get started with coding Lia bots or can give you some ideas of what you can do using our API.

Before you start browsing our examples we strongly recommend you to read our [getting started](/getting-started/) section where you will setup your environment and learn how to run games locally. It would also be good to skim through our [API](/api/) to see what data you receive during the game and what decisions you can make.

## Structure

All of the examples follow the same structure:

1. Overview of what the example does alongside with a gif or image
2. Full code of the example
3. Explanation of how it works

Some examples have a complete code with which you can replace your ```MyBot.java``` class, the code in those examples starts with ```import``` sentances. 
In other examples (eg. in [Rotation example](/examples/rotation/)) we only show the necessary code and you need to replace just the showcased parts, usually one of the ```process(...)``` methods.

## Where to start

If you are a complete beginner or if you have skipped our [Beginner tutorial](/tutorials/beginner-tutorial-part-1/) we recommend you to start of by going through the following examples:

* [Rotation example](/examples/rotation/) - Shows how to make your unit rotate
* [Movement example](/examples/movement/) - Shows how to move your unit
* [Shooting & ammo exampe](/examples/shooting-and-ammo/) - Shows how your units can shoot
* [Identifying the enemy example](/examples/identifying-the-enemy/) - Shows how your unit can detect an enemy
* [Following path example](/examples/following-path/) - Shows how your unit can follow a path on a map

If you have already finished our [Beginner tutorial](/tutorials/beginner-tutorial-part-1/) or have experiences with AI game development and want to figure things out by yourself, we recommend you to check the following tutorials:

* [Pathfinding example](/examples/pathfinding/) - Shows how your unit can navigate on the map all by itself
* [Multiple units example](/examples/multiple-units/) - Shows how you can manage multiple units at the same time

Happy coding!
